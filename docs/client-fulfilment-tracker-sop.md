# Client Fulfilment Tracker — SOP

How it is built, how to add a client, and how to work out what is wrong when a
number looks off.

Last updated 14 September 2026.

---

## 1. Where it is

**Dashboard → Client Fulfilment Tracker** (second tab), or go straight to
`/dashboard?tab=tracker`.

It is also listed in the left menu under Dashboard. It was not, until 14
September, which is why it was reported missing for a week — it existed as a tab
with no menu entry.

Three controls, matching the spreadsheet's own:

| Control | Options | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **Window** | 3 / 7 / 30 days | Counts are summed over the window, then divided |
| **Breakdown** | Campaign or Client | Some columns are unavailable per campaign — see §4 |
| **Client** | One, or all | |

All three live in the URL, so a view can be pasted to someone and they see the
same screen. Sorting is in the URL too.

---

## 2. What it is made of

Nothing in the tracker is typed in. Every figure is computed from feeds that
sync on a schedule, through two database views.

### The two views

| View | Grain | Supplies |
|---|---|---|
| `v_cft_stats_dashboard` | client × campaign × day | Spend, leads, appointments, outcomes |
| `v_cft_call_daily` | client × day | Everything in the call block |

They are **unioned, not joined**. A client that appears in one and not the other
still gets a row. Joining them would silently drop practices — eight of them, at
the time it was written.

### The feeds behind them

| Feed | Sync job | Writes to | Supplies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Meta ads, via Windsor | `windsor-ads` | `ad_level_insights`, `campaigns`, `ads` | Spend, impressions, clicks |
| Tracker sheet — leads tab | `fulfilment-leads` | `tracker_leads` | Leads |
| Tracker sheet — appointments | `fulfilment-tracker` | `tracker_appointments` | Appointments, shows, DQs, closes |
| CRM appointments | `crm-appointments` | `appointments`, `appointment_ledger` | Appointments the sheet never recorded |
| Call-centre dial log (HotProspector, via the call-centre workbook's RAW DATA tab) | `raw-call-rows` | `raw_call_rows` | Dials, pickups, conversations |
| CRM calls | `crm-calls` | `calls` | Fallback for days the dial log has no rows |
| CRM leads + either call feed | (view `v_lead_speed_to_lead`) | — | Speed to lead |

### When they run

| Schedule | What |
|---|---|
| `0 6 * * *` | `sync-all` — every feed above, in dependency order |
| `0 18 * * *` | `crm-appointments` again |
| `0 13,16,19,22 * * *` | `raw-call-rows` (call centre pay, and this tracker's call columns since migration 0096) |

Order inside `sync-all` matters: `crm-clients` runs first so a new practice has
a client row before anything tries to attach data to it.

### The one rule that governs every number

**Aggregate first, then divide.** No view stores a percentage. Counters are
summed across the whole window and only then divided.

Averaging a ratio across days gives the wrong answer whenever the days differ in
volume: a day with 1 lead and a day with 99 do not contribute equally to CPL,
but a mean of two CPLs treats them as though they did.

## 3. The columns, and where each one comes from

### Campaign information (A–F)

| Column | Source |
|---|---|
| Notes | Not stored. Always blank |
| Status | `clients.is_active` → Active / Paused |
| Client Name | `clients.name` |
| Campaign Name | `campaigns.name` |
| Campaign ID | The sheet's campaign id |
| Offer Name | Most common offer on that client's appointments |

### 1. Ad data (G–I)

| Column | Formula |
|---|---|
| Amount Spent | Σ `spend_cents` from Windsor |
| Leads | Greater of Windsor's lead count and the tracker's |
| CPL | Spend ÷ Leads |

**CPL is blank, not zero, when no spend is recorded.** Spend of zero against 30
leads does not mean the leads were free — it means no spend was recorded for
that campaign. £0.00 per lead is the most flattering possible lie.

### 2. Call data (J–O) — client grain only

Since migration 0096 the call columns come from the call-centre dial log
(`raw_call_rows`, HotProspector), not HighLevel's `calls`: the dial log has
about 8 times as many dials. On a day with no dial log rows at all (the Make
scenario that writes it stopped after 16 Sep 2026), that day falls back to
HighLevel calls; `v_cft_call_daily.call_source` says which. A call's day is its
date in the call centre's time zone (`app_settings.call_centre_hours`,
America/Los_Angeles). Dial log times are the lead's local time and are
converted; exact duplicate dial log rows count once.

| Column | Formula |
|---|---|
| Number of dialed calls | Outbound calls |
| Calls 2+ minutes | Picked-up calls of 120s or more, both directions |
| Speed To Lead | Average **call-centre working minutes** from HighLevel lead created to the first outbound dial to that phone number |
| Pickup % | Outbound pickups ÷ dialed |
| Conversation % | Outbound pickups of 2+ min ÷ dialed |
| Dials per Lead | Dials ÷ leads |

**What a pickup is depends on the feed.** The dial log's duration includes
ringing ("No Answer" dials run a median 31 s), so there a pickup is any dial
the agent dispositioned as something other than "No Answer". On HighLevel
fallback days it is an outbound call with talk time (see §6).

**Speed To Lead counts working time only**: 06:00–18:00 Pacific, Monday to
Saturday, from `app_settings.call_centre_hours` (change the hours there, no
deploy needed). A lead that arrives at 11 PM and is dialled at 6:05 AM counts
as 5 minutes. Leads and dials are matched on the last 10 digits of the phone
number, because dial log lead ids are HotProspector ids, not HighLevel ones.
Anything over 24 working hours is excluded from the average and shown beside
it as a count.

### 3. Appointment data (P–W)

| Column | Formula |
|---|---|
| Appointments Created | All appointments, both feeds |
| Appointments To Be Taken | Those with no outcome yet |
| Last Appt Date | Latest appointment date |
| Schedule % | **Tracker** appointments ÷ leads |
| Shows / No Shows / Cancels | From the appointment's status |
| DQ % | DQs ÷ appointments created |
| Cancel % | Cancels ÷ appointments created |
| Show % | Shows ÷ appointments created |

**Schedule % uses a different numerator from the column beside it**, and that is
not a mistake. See §6.

### 4. Deals (X–Z) and 5. KPI metrics (AA–AG)

| Column | Formula |
|---|---|
| Closes | Appointments marked Closed |
| Close % | Closes ÷ shows |
| Revenue | **Not recorded anywhere.** Always blank |
| ROI | Needs revenue. Always blank |
| Cost Per Booking | Spend ÷ appointments created |
| Cost Per Show | Spend ÷ shows |
| Cost Per Close | Spend ÷ closes |

All three cost columns are blank rather than zero when no spend is recorded.

## 4. Why some cells are hatched

A hatched cell means **this cannot be known at this grain** — which is different
from zero, and different from nobody having filled it in.

Switch the breakdown to **Client** and they fill in.

24 columns hatch at campaign grain, for two different reasons:

**Columns J–O, the call block.** The calls table carries no campaign reference
at all. Splitting one client's calls across their campaigns would be invention;
repeating the client total on every campaign row would double count.

**Columns H, I, P–AB, AE–AG, from the tracker sheet.** These exist per campaign
and are *wrong* per campaign. The sheet's campaign id is unreliable row by row:
Singleton Smile has 97 lead rows citing 16 different campaign ids, fifteen of
them other practices'. Fleet-wide, every campaign id is cited by leads from 3 to
29 different practices.

So the numbers are real at client grain and meaningless at campaign grain. That
is a defect in the sheet's campaign id column, not in the Hub.

---

## 5. Adding a client to the tracker

A practice appears in the tracker when it has a `clients` row and at least one
feed carries data for it. There is no "add to tracker" step — it is driven off
the identifiers below.

### The three identifiers

| Field | Needed for | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| `crm_location_id` | Appointments, calls | GoHighLevel sub-account id |
| `ad_account_id` | Spend, impressions, clicks, CPL | Meta ad account (`act_…`) |
| `group_id` | Portal, grouping locations | The practice this location belongs to |

### Steps

1. **Confirm the client row exists.** `crm-clients` creates it automatically
   from GoHighLevel on the 6am sync. Check **Settings → Clients**.
2. **Map the ad account** in **Settings → Ad accounts**. Without this the
   practice gets no spend, and therefore no CPL, no cost per booking, and no
   cost per show — the row will look half empty and nothing will say why.
3. **Check the practice's name in the tracker sheet matches** the client name in
   the Hub. Leads and appointments are matched on the location name the sheet
   carries. A rename on one side and not the other silently orphans the rows.
4. **Wait for the next cycle**, or trigger it from Settings. Since 16 September
   the tracker refreshes on its own: the ISR sheet, every stat sheet and the
   ledger every 15 minutes; Windsor spend every hour on the hour; new
   GoHighLevel bookings every hour at half past. The full daily passes (06:00
   sync-all, 18:00 full crm-appointments) still run and are what corrects
   history. Spend can lag the others by a few hours because Windsor refreshes
   its copy of Meta on its own schedule.
5. **Verify** by opening the tracker at Client breakdown, 30 days, and picking
   the practice. Spend, leads and appointments should all be non-zero.

### 13 active practices have no ad account mapped

They can show appointments but never spend or CPL. This is the single biggest
cause of a row looking broken. As of 15 September, after mapping every practice
on Joshua's campaign list and every name that matches Jemie's Business Manager
list, and reading the ad copy behind every unnamed account (migrations 0083
to 0087):

**Have a stat sheet, so bookings show against no spend:** Snyder Dental Group
(22 appts) · Royal Dentistry Studio (10) · Glamorous Smile Dental Spa (7) ·
Smile Now Align (2) · Stanton Dental Care (1) · TMJ Sleep Airway Orthodontics -
Ponte Vedra (0).

**Mapped but Windsor cannot see the account:** Eagle Creek Dentistry
(`1954291958818137`) and Dental Design Studios (`689259685445341`) are mapped
from the Business Manager list, but neither account is connected to Windsor, so
they still show bookings against zero spend. Connecting them in Windsor is the
only remaining step; nothing in the Hub needs to change.

**No stat sheet either, so nothing can land:** Evergreen Dental and
Orthodontics · Firewheel Smiles · Habib Dental Implants · Skyline Implants &
Periodontics.

**Churned per Joshua but still marked active in the Hub:** Limestone Hills
Orthodontics (55 appts) · Metro Dental & Implant Studio (46). Their group status
should be set to churned so they drop out of coverage counts.

**"Great Smiles of La Mesa (Dont use)"** is a duplicate client row and should be
deactivated rather than mapped.

None of the thirteen is on Joshua's campaign list, in the Business Manager list
under a matching name, or named in the copy of any ad Windsor returned in the
last year. Each needs its ad account id from whoever runs its ads. Two Business
Manager accounts remain unassigned for the same reason: Stephen Tran DDS ran no
ad in a year, and Wagner Orthodontics A is not connected to Windsor.

### When the account name lies

Meta's account names are whatever the media buyer typed. Four accounts were
identified only by reading their ad copy: **NYO** is Natalie Yang
Orthodontics ("Dr. Natalie Yang", Vacaville); **Buena Park Dental Center** is
Anaheim Smile Center's second location ("Dr. Zakhary has 2 locations");
**AC - Select Dental Implants** is Diamond Dental's implant brand; and
**All Dental of Menifee (Apex)** ran nothing but Apex hiring campaigns all
year, so the internal hiring client owns it and its spend reaches the
Recruitment page, not a practice row.

### When a campaign is in the wrong account

Media buyers open a campaign in whichever account is handy. In the last year
Ad Account 10 (TMJ Williston) carried two Team Dental campaigns, Ad Account 7
(Wilmington) carried two for Smile Orthodontics, and Ad Account 6 (Singleton)
carried $37.7k for NK Orthodontics in Atlanta, which is not a client.

The Windsor sync therefore consults the campaign map before the account owner.
A campaign the map assigns to exactly one client lands on that client whatever
account it arrived in. A campaign the map names for a practice that is not a
Hub client is dropped rather than given to the account owner. A campaign the
map lists for several clients (the three TMJ doors) falls back to the account
owner. To move a campaign, add a row to the campaign map in the database; no
code change is needed.

### Shared accounts: one owner, others linked

Meta cannot split one campaign between two doors. Where locations share a
campaign, one client **owns** the spend and the others are **linked** in
Settings → Ad accounts, so the relationship is visible without double counting:

| Account | Owns the spend | Linked |
|---|---|---|
| `1364841078777057` Ad Account 10 | TMJ Williston | TMJ Gainesville, TMJ New York |
| `1307464760364126` Village Dental of New England | Village Dental | Village Dental (General Dentistry) |
| `2448322745599201` Ad Account 12 | Team Dental N. Liberties | Team Dental Swedesboro |

SMYLE Dental Centers owns two accounts (`827429053287394`, `1189070893015233`);
both land on its row.

## 5b. How every column fills at campaign grain (16 September 2026)

Until 16 September the campaign view hatched out Leads, CPL, every appointment
column and every call column, because the sheet's campaign id was wrong row by
row and calls carry no campaign at all. Both are now handled at the source and
every column shows a number.

**Leads and appointments.** The tracker view places each lead and booking by
one rule. If the row cites a campaign that belongs to its own practice, that
campaign is kept. Otherwise it goes on the practice's own campaign with the
most spend in the 30 days up to that day. A practice with no campaign keeps
"(no campaign)". Measured the day this shipped, 1,072 of 1,176 leads already
cited their own campaign; 78 of 88 sheet appointments cited another
practice's and are corrected. For the 35 practices running one campaign the
rule is exact. For SMYLE, Kind Dental and Village Dental, which run more than
one, an unattributed booking lands on the campaign that was spending most that
month, which is an estimate. Totals never change; only the row a lead or
booking sits on.

**Calls.** A call carries no campaign, so a campaign row shows the practice's
calls apportioned by that row's share of the practice's leads in the window
(by spend if it has no leads, equally if it has neither), rounded so the
practice's rows add back to its true total. Pickup %, Conversation %, Speed to
Lead and Dials per Lead on a campaign row are therefore the practice's own
rates. This is the one place the campaign view shows an estimate rather than
a measurement, and it is the same estimate the spreadsheet makes when it
copies a practice's call figures onto each campaign row.

## 6. Two places the Hub deliberately disagrees with the spreadsheet

Both are recorded here so nobody "fixes" them back.

### Pickup % is measured on talk time

The sheet counts GoHighLevel's `connected` flag. That flag is set when a call
attempt finishes at the carrier, **not** when a person answers — 3,292 of 6,691
outbound calls carry it with zero seconds of audio.

On that definition the fleet read **97.8%** and every practice landed between
97.6% and 100%, so the column could not tell any of them apart. On talk time they
run from **2.3% to 62.9%**:

| Practice | Old | Real |
|---|---|---|
| DNA Dental Studio | 99.7% | 5.3% |
| Glamorous Smile Dental Spa | 100% | 2.3% |
| City Dental Centers | 98.0% | 62.9% |

The Hub will read **lower** than the sheet here. That is the Hub being right.

### Schedule % counts only tracker appointments

Appointments come from two feeds:

- **1,273** from the tracker sheet, carrying a campaign
- **1,420** from the CRM ledger, carrying no campaign, no spend and no lead

Leads all sit on campaign rows. Counting all 2,693 against 2,220 leads gave
**121.3%** — more bookings than leads, which is not a rate. Matched against the
feed the leads come from, it reads **57.3%**.

`Appointments Created` still counts all 2,693, because those CRM bookings are
real appointments that real practices really took.

### Settled: Cost Per Booking

Joshua, 14 September: **"Cost per booking we got is the metric we are to use."**

That is what the column already does — spend divided by every appointment,
including the ones no ad paid for. No change was needed. Recorded here so the
question is not reopened.

### The sheet holds 47% of the appointments

Also Joshua, 14 September: *"The appts in GHL are more accurate than the ones in
the sheet."* Measured, and by a wider margin than assumed.

GoHighLevel carries 2,693 appointments. The tracker sheet carries 1,273 of them.
**1,420 exist only in the CRM, and six practices have nothing in the sheet at
all** — Limestone Hills 0 of 55, Metro Dental 0 of 46.

The relationship is one-directional: not one practice has an appointment in the
sheet that the CRM lacks. So nothing in the sheet needs correcting — things need
**adding**.

The tracker shows the per-practice gap under **What the sheet is missing**,
ordered by how many are absent, so it doubles as the worklist and shows when it
is finished.

The Hub cannot fix this itself. The Google scope is `spreadsheets.readonly` on
purpose, so a bug here can never write to the thing everybody trusts.

**What it affects:** Schedule % divides sheet appointments by sheet leads —
consistent, but both sides undercounted, so it reports the sheet's view of the
world rather than the world. Appointments Created, Shows, and the rates built on
them already count both sources and are unaffected.

### Open question for whoever owns the sheet

**Cost Per Booking divides spend by ALL appointments**, including the 1,420 that
no ad paid for. It therefore reads lower than reality.

Two defensible answers — cost per booking we *paid for*, or cost per booking we
*got* — and unlike 121% neither is impossible, so this has been left alone
pending a decision. Changing it is one line.

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Start here: the freshness line

The tracker shows the last day each feed actually delivered — spend, leads,
appointments, calls. **Check this first.** Most "the numbers are wrong" reports
are one stale feed, and the line says which.

### A whole practice is missing

1. Does it have a `clients` row? Settings → Clients.
2. Is it marked internal? Internal clients are excluded on purpose.
3. Is it active?
4. Does the name in the tracker sheet match the Hub's client name exactly?

### One practice shows appointments but no spend

Almost always a missing `ad_account_id`. See §5.

### Spend with no impressions: 15 July to 6 August

**Resolved 14 September.** This is not three practices, it is 34, and it is not
a handful of rows — it is **3,777 rows and $43,562 of spend**, which is 42% of
all spend the Hub has ever recorded.

Every day from **15 July to 6 August 2026** carries spend with impressions,
clicks and reach at exactly zero. Impressions begin on 7 August and are healthy
from then on. The same boundary appears in `ad_snapshots`, so it is the source
of the data rather than one table.

**The cause is ours, not Windsor's.** The Hub only started syncing on 21 August;
everything older arrived in a one-off backfill on 4 September, and that backfill
brought spend without delivery. Asking Windsor for those same July dates today
returns impressions in full — Ultra Smiles' account returns 15–22 July with
6,000–8,000 impressions a day.

Availability varies by ad account rather than by a single global cutoff: one
account returned nothing before 12 August while another returned all of July. So
expect a repair to fill most of the gap, not all of it.

**To repair it:**

```
GET /api/sync/windsor-ads?days=65
```

`days` is capped at 400 and ignored unless it is a positive integer. The run
logs the widened window and records it on the `sync_runs` row, so the repair is
visible afterwards. Nothing needs setting back — the parameter lives in the
request, not the environment.

**Until it is run**, anything built on impressions or clicks is wrong for that
period: the Impressions and Clicks columns here, and CTR and CPC on Creative
Performance. Creative Performance excludes anything under 5,000 impressions, so
affected creatives drop out of the ranking rather than ranking falsely — but
their spend still shows in the held-back total.

**A standing lesson worth keeping:** a feed that fails quietly is only
repairable while the source still holds the data. Check the freshness line.

### Everything is empty for every practice

A sync failed. Check the sync run log, then re-run `sync-all`. Feeds are
independent, so a failure in one leaves the others intact — which is why a
partly-empty tracker is more common than a wholly empty one.

### A number looks wrong but not impossible

Work down this list:

1. **Which grain?** Campaign grain hatches 24 columns. Switch to Client.
2. **Which window?** 3 days on a practice that books twice a month shows zero,
   correctly.
3. **Is it a rate with a small denominator?** 1 show out of 1 appointment is
   100% and means nothing.
4. **Is the denominator blank rather than zero?** Blank means unknowable, and is
   deliberate throughout.
5. **Is it one of the two deliberate divergences in §6?**

### Checks you can run

```bash
npm run check:cft
```

68 assertions over the tracker's arithmetic — column letters, section spans,
which columns hatch at which grain, and every derived rate. Run it after any
change to `cft-stats.ts` or `cft-columns.ts`.

Related suites: `check:tracker`, `check:commission`, `check:pay`,
`check:booking`.

---

## 8. Known limitations

**No ad can be traced to a booking.** All 1,443 appointments carry an empty ad
id, and so does every row from the tracker. The only ad attribution anywhere is
on tracker leads, where 480 of 1,101 resolvable rows name an ad belonging to a
*different* practice.

This is the binding constraint on creative testing. Hook/body/CTA combinations
can be measured on clicks and cost, and cannot be measured on bookings, until
something stamps the ad id onto the appointment. It is a tracker change, and it
is far cheaper to start recording now than to backfill later.

**Revenue and ROI are permanently blank** until case values are recorded
somewhere.

**Campaign-grain reporting is unavailable** for anything sheet-sourced, because
the sheet's campaign id is cross-contaminated. Fixing that means fixing the
column at source — whoever owns it needs to stamp the practice's own campaign id
rather than whatever was last in the cell.
