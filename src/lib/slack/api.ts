 * incoming webhook. The difference is what each one has to do. An alert only
 * ever posts one message to one channel, so a webhook — which can do nothing
 * else even if it leaks — is exactly right. A bot has to read who tagged it,
 * reply in the thread it was tagged in, and react to the message, none of which
 * a webhook can do at all.
 *
 * SLACK RETURNS 200 WHEN IT FAILS. Every method answers `{ok: false, error}`
 * over HTTP 200, so checking `response.ok` alone reports success for a call
 * that was rejected for a missing scope. That is the single easiest way to
 * ship a bot that silently does nothing, so the body is what is checked here.
 *
 * Everything is best-effort in the same sense the sync alerts are: the ticket
 * row is the durable record, and a Slack outage must not stop one being filed.
 * The functions return null rather than throwing, and the route decides what a
 * null means for the reply it sends.
