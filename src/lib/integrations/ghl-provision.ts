/**
 * Creating a GoHighLevel sub-account from a snapshot, and filling its custom
 * values.
 *
 * Separate from integrations/ghl.ts because everything here WRITES. That file is
 * read-only and safe to call speculatively; nothing in this one is.
 *
 * ============================== SCOPES ==============================
 * These calls need an agency-level credential with `locations.write` and
 * `locations/customValues.write`.
 *
 * The marketplace app does not have them. Tested rather than assumed: GET
 * /locations/ and GET /locations/{id} both answer 200, GET /snapshots/ answers
 * 401, and a real POST /locations/ answered
 *
 *     401 {"message":"The token is not authorized for this scope."}
 *
 * which is GoHighLevel saying the scope was never granted rather than the call
 * being wrong. Hence writeAuth() below and GHL_PRIVATE_TOKEN: a private
 * integration's scopes are chosen in the GoHighLevel UI, so this is a minute's
 * work instead of reinstalling the app across the agency.
 *
 * Every failure carries the HTTP status and body through to the caller for that
 * reason — "401 from POST /locations/" sends somebody to the right screen, and
 * "could not create sub-account" sends them nowhere.
 * ====================================================================
