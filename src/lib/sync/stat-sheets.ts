/**
 * Appointments from every practice's own stat sheet.
 *
 * Each practice has one. Their ids are in pps_clinic_routing, verified in
 * September by reading the Location ID column out of each live sheet and
 * matching it to crm_location_id — so the set of sheets is known and checked,
 * and no Drive folder listing is needed. That matters: the Hub's Google scope
 * is spreadsheets.readonly, which reads a sheet by id and cannot list a folder.
 *
 * HEADER-DRIVEN, NOT COLUMN-LETTER-DRIVEN, and that is not a stylistic
 * preference. The sheet's own labels are already known to mislead — it heads
 * two different columns "Ad ID" and "Ad Name" and fills both from the same
 * GoHighLevel field. Reading by position would bake that in; reading by header
 * means a sheet that differs is reported rather than silently misparsed.
 *
 * ALL 49 SHEETS WERE AUDITED ON 14 SEPTEMBER, and the two things that matter
 * are settled.
 *
 * Ad ID is empty on 41 of 46 audited. Five carry anything at all and only four
 * hold real Meta ad ids — 22 rows across roughly 1,113. Singleton Smile has 13
 * and is the only practice with enough distinct ads to compare two creatives.
 * So a booking cannot be traced to an ad, fleet-wide, and the ~250 ads planned
 * for October cannot be measured on bookings unless utm_content starts
 * carrying the ad id BEFORE they run.
 *
 * Campaign ID is populated 121 times and Treatment Value 308 — nearly four and
 * ten times the ad column. Campaign grain and case value work where ad grain
 * does not.
 *
 * NINE SHEETS USE AN OLDER LAYOUT, which is why this file reads by header and
 * not by column letter. On those, W is "Make Remarks" rather than Date Booked,
 * and everything after shifts one left: Ad ID sits at Z, AB holds "First
 * Called", and AC/AD do not exist. Reading by position would have pulled a
 * call timestamp into the ad column for a fifth of the fleet and reported it
 * as attribution.
