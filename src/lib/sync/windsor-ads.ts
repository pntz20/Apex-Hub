 * threw away all but the first copy.
 *
 * The evidence is the arithmetic, which closes exactly on every run:
 *
 *   5-7 Sep   20 accounts mapped, 2 batches, each row arrived 2x
 *             read 7,002 = created 2,383 + duplicates 2,383 + skipped 2,236

 *             read 14,596 = created 3,489 + duplicates 10,467 + skipped 640
 *
 * Duplicates are always (batches - 1) x unique. Mapping twelve more accounts
 * did not bring more data; it brought two more copies of the same data and
 * quadrupled the request count.
 *
 * So one batch. Same rows, a quarter of the requests, and the duplicate
 * counter drops to whatever Windsor genuinely repeats — which is the number
