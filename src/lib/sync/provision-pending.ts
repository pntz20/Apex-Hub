/**
 * Finishes any onboarding submission that has not got a working sub-account yet.
 *
 * Provisioning already runs when the form is submitted, so this exists for the
 * case that actually happens: the call was refused for a reason outside the form
 * — a missing scope, a stale token, GoHighLevel having a bad minute — and the fix
 * lands later. Without this, every one of those needs somebody to remember to go
 * and press a button.
 *
 * It runs on the daily schedule and can be run by hand from settings, so a
 * granted scope repairs the backlog on its own rather than being a click nobody
 * makes.
 *
 * Safe to run repeatedly. A submission whose account exists is configured rather
 * than duplicated, and a submission already finished is skipped entirely.
