/**
 * Leads from GoHighLevel — the feed the Hub never had.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 *
 * Joshua reports that the Hub's lead numbers do not agree with GoHighLevel.
 * They cannot: no sync has ever read leads from the CRM. What the Hub reports
 * is greatest(Windsor, the tracker sheet), and Meta returns zero for 35 of the
 * 39 accounts that spent money last month. So the disagreement is a missing
 * feed rather than a miscount — and neither side of the argument can be
 * settled until both counts sit next to each other.
 *
 * This fills crm_leads. v_lead_reconciliation puts the three side by side.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A LEAD
 *
 * A contact created in the window, by dateAdded. Not a tag and not a pipeline
 * stage: both are configured per sub-account by whoever built the automation,
 * so counting them would compare practices by their CRM setup rather than by
 * how many people enquired.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
 *
 * It does not write to GoHighLevel. It does not delete: a contact removed in
 * the CRM stays here, because a lead that arrived and was later tidied away
 * still cost what it cost to acquire.
 *
 * FIRST RUN IS A DISCOVERY RUN
 *
 * /contacts/ has not been read before. The field names come from
 * GoHighLevel's documentation rather than from a live payload — the same
 * position the tracker import was in when it demanded "booked for" from a
 * sheet that says "Date Booked" and failed twice. So it reports the key names
 * it received, how many contacts it could not place, and whether it hit its
 * page cap. Key names and counts only; never a value.
