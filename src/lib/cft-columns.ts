/*
 * Nothing is blocked at campaign grain any more. Two predicates used to live
 * here and both are gone for reasons worth keeping:
 *
 * callsOnly hatched the six call columns (J to O) at campaign grain because
 * a call carries no campaign. It still does not. The call counters a campaign
 * row shows are the practice's calls apportioned by that row's share of the
 * practice's leads (see cft-stats), so a practice's rows sum back to its real
 * total and the rates on each row are the practice's rates. An estimate, and
 * labelled as one in the SOP; better than a hatched section under a heading
 * that reads "CALL DATA" on a tracker with 7,000 calls in it.
 *
 * campaignIdUnreliable hatched Leads, CPL and every appointment column
 * because the sheet's campaign id was wrong row by row. Measured again on
 * 16 September 2026: 1,072 of 1,176 leads cite their own practice's
 * campaign, and the view (0088) now corrects the rest - and the appointments,
 * which were still 78 of 88 wrong - onto the practice's own campaign. The
 * corruption is handled where the campaign is decided, so the columns can
 * show what is there.
 */

/*
 * Everything sourced from the tracker sheet, blocked at campaign grain.
 *
 * Same test as callsOnly and a completely different reason, which is why it is
 * a separate name: call data simply is not collected per campaign, whereas this
 * data exists per campaign and is wrong.
 *
 * The sheet's campaign id is not reliable row by row. Singleton Smile Dental
 * has 97 lead rows citing 16 distinct campaign ids, fifteen of them other
 * practices' campaigns, and 40 appointment rows citing 21. Fleet-wide every
 * campaign id is cited by leads from 3 to 29 different practices out of about
 * 35 — the campaign named "Apex | Singleton Smile Dental | $3789 for Invisalign
 * All In" is cited by leads from 29 of them. The corruption is in
 * tracker_leads and tracker_appointments themselves, so it arrives from the
 * sheet rather than from anything here.
 *
 * The consequence is not imprecision. The leads on a campaign row mostly are
 * not that campaign's leads, so a campaign-grain CPL, schedule rate or show
 * rate is answering a question about a set of leads nobody chose. Hatched
 * rather than shown: "this cannot be known here" is true, and a plausible wrong
 * number is worse than an honest gap.
 *
 * Client grain is unaffected and correct — leads and spend both attach to the
 * right practice, and only the campaign link between them is corrupt. See
 * v_cft_campaign_spend_coverage for how far off each practice would have been.
 *
 * Unblocked 16 September 2026: the sheet's campaign column became trustworthy
 * for leads, and 0088 corrects it for appointments. See the note above.
