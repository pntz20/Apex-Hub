/**
 * The @apex ticket bot.
 *
 * Tag @apex in any Slack channel it has been invited to and the message becomes
 * a tech support ticket on the Hub, with a threaded reply saying so.
 *
 * It lands on Ally by default. Tag somebody else in the same message and it
 * lands on them instead — but only a real Slack mention counts, never a name
 * typed as words. lib/slack/assignee carries the reasoning, which is the same
 * reasoning that keeps this route from guessing which practice a ticket is
 * about: a name in prose carries no intent, and "ayanda is out today" must not
 * assign anything to Ayanda.
 *
 * WHY THIS ROUTE IS NOT GUARDED LIKE THE OTHERS
 *
 * Every other machine-to-machine route here checks SERVICE_API_KEY, which works
 * because Make can be told to send an Authorization header. Slack cannot. The
 * request URL is configured once in the Slack app and Slack alone decides what
 * it sends, so the URL is effectively public and the request signature is the
 * authentication. lib/slack/signature carries the detail, including why the raw
 * body has to be read as text before anything parses it.
 *
 * WHY A RETRY CANNOT FILE A SECOND TICKET
 *
 * Slack gives an endpoint three seconds and retries up to three times when it
 * does not answer, and the retry is byte-identical to the original. This route
 * does real work before answering — a users.info call, a permalink call, an
 * insert — and a cold start alone can eat most of the budget, so retries are
 * expected rather than exceptional.
 *
 * Rather than answering 200 immediately and doing the work afterwards, which on
 * a serverless function means the work may simply not happen, the ticket is
 * filed inline and the (slack_channel_id, slack_message_ts) unique index makes
 * the second attempt a no-op: the insert conflicts, the existing ticket is read
 * back, and the retry gets the same answer the first attempt would have given.
 * The bot posts its reply only on the attempt that actually created the row, so
 * three deliveries produce one ticket and one reply.
 *
 * NOT EVERY MENTION IS A REQUEST
 *
 * An announcement about the bot — "for any tech support, please tag @Apex" —
 * used to become a ticket, assigned to Ally, for a message explaining how to
 * file tickets. lib/slack/classify decides; when it declines, the message is
 * kept in tech_ticket_candidates and the thread is told so, and reacting
 * :ticket: promotes it to a real ticket with nothing retyped.
 *
 * Declining fails open everywhere: no API key, a timeout, a malformed answer,
 * all file the ticket. Noise costs a minute; a swallowed request costs work
 * nobody knows is missing.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO
 *
 * A bare "@apex" with no words after it does not become a ticket. It gets a
 * threaded reply asking what is wrong. The alternative — filing "(no
 * description)" — turns silence into a row somebody has to chase, which is the
 * same mistake the consultation webhook refuses to make with a blank
 * attendance answer.
 *
 * It also never guesses which practice a ticket is about. See lib/slack/mention.
