/**
 * New bookings from GoHighLevel, every hour, without re-reading the whole record.
 *
 * crm-appointments' full pass reads every consultation event since January 2025
 * and takes 200 to 280 seconds against a 300-second limit. It runs that way
 * once a day at 18:00 and must keep doing so: outcomes of past appointments
 * change after the fact, and only the full pass sees them.
 *
 * This route asks for the same calendars but only for events that START from
 * three days ago onward. A booking made this morning for any future date sits
 * inside that window, so nothing new is missed; what is skipped is history the
 * daily pass owns. Same number of requests, far smaller responses, and it fits
 * an hourly schedule with room to spare.
 *
 * Three days rather than one so a booking edited or cancelled shortly after it
 * was made is corrected on the next cycle, not the next evening.
 *
 * appointment-ledger follows, because it is what turns b2c appointments into
 * the booked / showed / no-show counts the tracker and the client portal read.
 * Without it a new booking would be in the database and not on the page.
