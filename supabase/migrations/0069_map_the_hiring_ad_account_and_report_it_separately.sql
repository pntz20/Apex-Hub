-- Ad Account 13 is recruitment, not a practice.
--
-- 1522430326001923 reported 119 of the fleet's 157 leads on $526 and could not
-- be mapped from data — it runs campaigns the Hub has never seen. Migration
-- 0047 left it unmapped and said it needed somebody who knows the accounts.
-- Joshua does: it is the hiring ads.
--
-- The economics corroborate it without needing anyone's word. $526 for 119
-- leads is $4.42 each. Dental patient leads on this fleet run $40 to $108. A
-- figure an order of magnitude below the rest is a different product, and that
-- product is job applicants.
--
-- WHY IT MATTERS BEYOND TIDINESS: those 119 leads were three quarters of the
-- fleet's reported lead volume. Left unmapped they sat outside every practice's
-- numbers, which was accidentally the right answer. Mapped to a PRACTICE they
-- would have been catastrophically wrong — a recruitment lead is not a patient,
-- and $4.42 blended into a practice's cost per lead makes its marketing look
-- twice as effective as it is.
--
-- So it is attached to an INTERNAL client, and 0068 is what makes that safe:
-- internal clients no longer reach the Client Fulfilment Tracker at all. The
-- spend becomes visible and attributable without ever touching a client figure.
--
-- THE ASSUMPTION, stated because it is one: the only active internal account
-- with "Hiring" in its name is "Singleton Smile [Hiring Account]", a real
-- GoHighLevel sub-account carrying no leads and no campaigns. Joshua said
-- "hiring ads" without naming an entity. If this is agency-wide recruitment
-- rather than Singleton's specifically, the fix is to move one column to a
-- different internal client — nothing else depends on the choice.

-- Recruitment ad performance, reported on its own terms.
--
-- Joshua asked for campaign name, cost per lead and amount spent. Those are the
-- three columns. It reads the same insight tables the client tracker reads, but
-- scoped to internal accounts — so recruitment gets a real report instead of
-- being an unexplained gap in the fleet totals.
--
-- Expect this to be EMPTY until the next Windsor sync. Campaigns are ingested
-- per mapped client and this account had no mapping until the statement above,
-- so the Hub holds none of its campaigns yet. Empty tomorrow morning would mean
-- something is wrong; empty now is expected.
