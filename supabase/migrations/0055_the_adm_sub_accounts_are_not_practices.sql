-- The ADM sub-accounts are not practices.
--
-- crm-leads read sixty sub-accounts and counted the contacts of all of them as
-- client leads. Three of those are Apex's own:
--
--   ADM Team Management            100 leads
--   ADM Sales Account                4
--   ADM Client Onboarding Account    1
--
-- 105 of 617, seventeen per cent, and not one of them a dental patient. They
-- are team members, sales prospects and onboarding records — the contacts of
-- the agency's own tooling.
--
-- ADM Team Management is also the account that broke the last two runs. It is
-- the only sub-account with more than a page of contacts in a fortnight, so it
-- was the only one paging was ever attempted on: it truncated at exactly 100
-- on one run and returned a 400 on the next. The paging bug's only victim was
-- an account that should never have been read.
--
-- 0017 already has the column and the convention: is_internal means "not a
-- practice — a test account, another agency, a vendor, an internal product
-- account or a hiring account", set EXPLICITLY rather than inferred, because
-- the only data signal is having no appointments and no charges and a newly
-- signed clinic looks identical.
--
-- These seven are explicit in the same way. Every one is named for the agency
-- itself, every one is inactive, and each is a piece of Apex's own GoHighLevel
-- furniture rather than somewhere patients are booked.

comment on view v_lead_reconciliation is
  'One row per practice per day with all three lead counts and the gap. '
  'crm_leads is the reference: it is the only source that records a lead when '
  'it arrives rather than when somebody types it or Meta decides to report it. '
  'Internal sub-accounts are excluded — the agency''s own Team Management '
  'account alone contributed 100 of the first 617 CRM leads. '
  'reported_minus_crm is signed: negative means the Hub reports more leads than '
  'the CRM holds, which is a different problem from reporting fewer. '
  'Sheet leads come from v_tracker_leads_effective, so a lead in two tabs is '
  'counted once.';
